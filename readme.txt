The Datathon.csv file was the file provided at the hackathon to be analysed by the participants.
This file consists of the data on a programming contest taken up by various people where each question carries 100 marks and not attempting the question results in negative marking(-1 marks).

The code.py file is the file that was designed by our team which works on the Datathon.csv file to provide certain insights on the data.

If the code needs to be tested, the path of the file in line 10 needs to be changed. The code is written in anaconda python and jupyter noebook can be used to run the file.

if the code cannot be run and tested, the graphs that are generated by the code have been enclosed along with the code for reference.
